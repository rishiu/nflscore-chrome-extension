A very simple chrome extension that shows nfl scores for postseason or regular season. 

Since it's not on the chrome web store, you can get it by cloning this repository using

git clone https://github.com/rishiu/nflscore-chrome-extension.git

Then save the files into a folder and go to chrome settings. Go to extensions and enable developer mode in the top right corner. Then, click load unpacked extension, browse to the folder and enjoy!
